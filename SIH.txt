Prompt for App Design

"Design a modern, interactive educational app with four main modes: Classroom Mode, Story Teller/Explainer Mode, Teaching Mode, and Personal Development Mode. The app should have a clean, user-friendly interface with smooth navigation and a focus on engagement. Each mode must have its own unique color theme and icon for easy identification.
